BTW guys. Make sure you throw all your additions to the test branch first rather than main


Breakdown of work:

Ahmed Ali:
-Created Github Repo and .ignore (Making sure y'all don't get stuck with my 4329 Node Module folder and 5 .DS_Stores ðŸ˜­)

-Added more stuff to our Gitignore to avoid issues with package-json, .idea and way more

-Set up Collab Features. YAY.

-Added Way too much comments to Delete Function


Caleb Campbell:
-bought slurpee


Alvin Sin:
-Implemented Delete Function
